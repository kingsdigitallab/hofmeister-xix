            <p>Searching is the most powerful means of accessing the information in Hofmeister XIX,
                using one or more different fields, together where desired with a date range. Four
                types of search are available:</p>
            <list>
                <item>
                    <xref type="internal" from="search_basic">Basic search</xref>
                </item>
                <item>
                    <xref type="internal" from="search_advanced">Advanced search</xref>
                </item>
                <item>
                    <xref type="internal" from="search_free_text">Free text search</xref>
                </item>
                <item>
                    <xref type="internal" from="search_list">List search</xref>
                </item>
            </list>
           <p>The purpose of the first three is to locate individual bibliographical items. List
                search is for extracting information about the items, such as a listing of all
                composers published at a particular time and place.</p>
            <!-- <p>Searching is the most powerful means of accessing the information in Hofmeister XIX,
                using one or more different fields, together where desired with a date range. Four
                types of search are available: <xref type="internal" from="search_basic">Basic
                    search</xref>, <xref type="internal" from="search_advanced">Advanced
                search</xref>, <xref type="internal" from="search_free_text">Free text
                search</xref>, and <xref type="internal" from="search_list">List search</xref>. The
                purpose of the first three is to locate individual bibliographical items, and in
                each case you can follow a link to the relevant facsimile page on the <xref
                    url=" http://www.onb.ac.at/sammlungen/musik/hofmeister1.htm">Österreichische
                    Nationalbibliothek</xref> website; the last (List search) is for extracting
                information about the items, such as a listing of all composers published at a
                particular time and place.</p>
            <list>
                <item><xref type="internal" from="search_basic">Basic search</xref> allows
                    straightforward searching using one or two fields, with an optional date range.
                    Searching is based on <xref type="internal" from="p3_5">thesauri</xref> for all
                    fields other than title, and where two fields are used they are linked by AND
                    (for instance results might be limited to just the works of a specified composer
                    published in a specified place). For textual input, searching is neither case
                    nor accent sensitive (thus 'marsche' will find 'Märsche').</item>
                <item><xref type="internal" from="search_advanced">Advanced search</xref> provides
                    the same functionality as Basic search, but with many more options: additional
                    fields with the possibilities of searching on three at once and of specifying
                    the logical relations between them, the option in the case of most fields of
                    performing either thesaurus or literal searches, and the ability to sort the
                    results by specified fields. For textual input, searching is neither case nor
                    accent sensitive (thus 'marsche' will find 'Märsche'), and wildcard characters
                    (?, *) may be used.</item>
                <item><xref type="internal" from="search_free_text">Free text search</xref> makes it
                    possible to search for specific words regardless of the field(s) in which they
                    appear. As in the case of Advanced search, it is possible to search for just one
                    or all of the search terms, and in the latter case in the specified sequence or
                    in any sequence. Results may be sorted by specified fields. Searching is neither
                    case nor accent sensitive (thus 'marsche' will find 'Märsche'), and wildcard
                    characters (?, *) may be used.</item>
                <item><xref type="internal" from="search_list">List search</xref> does not find
                    individual bibliographical items: as its name indicates, it creates lists of
                    terms appearing in certain fields under certain conditions, such as all the
                    composers published in a particular place within certain dates. It is also
                    possible to exclude certain results (e.g. list composers published in Leipzig
                    between 1830 and 1849, except those published by Hofmeister). Thesauri may used.
                    For textual input, searching is neither case nor accent sensitive (thus
                    'marsche' will find 'Märsche').</item>
            </list>
            <p>More details of these four types of search may be found on the <xref type="internal"
                    from="p3_5">Seach help page</xref>.</p>-->
